# ProofPoint URL-Defense Decoder:

I created this tool because I needed a way to decode re-written/encoded URL's from ProofPoint in a GUI-based tool. This was originally designed to be compiled using pyinstaller and run as an exe on Windows OS machines, but it should work as a binary on Linux kernel environments.

The official documentation on ProofPoint's re-write process can be found at this [LINK](https://help.proofpoint.com/Proofpoint_Essentials/Email_Security/User_Topics/Targeted_Attack_Protection/URL_Defense_FAQ's). Also an ‚ùóIMPORTANT note, part of this code is written by a ProofPoint engineer who exposes the decoding process as a Python class that can be used. I took that functionality and incorporated it into this GUI setup, but I do not claim the rights to this code and all attribution goes to the original author.

## Tool Functionality:

- Will create a GUI that will accept a encoded URL and return the decoded URL
- Can accept copy/paste or manually typed encoded URL

## Tool Requirements:

- To use the default functionality of this tool (watching folders, and creating hashes) a library will need to be installed using pip
  - [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)
- This tool needs a ![small](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80045938/148561762-9590c4a1-a424-4c7b-a0fb-68190fb7a31c.png) [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) interpreter, v3.6 or higher due to string interpolation

## Quick Notes:

- This can be converted to a standalone exe if run on Windows OS
- This should work on Linux, OSX, or Windows OS's
- I have provided a couple of encoded URL examples that can be tested in the 'example_encoded_urls.txt' file

## Using the Tool:

#### Step 1:

Run the binary or standalone exe to start the tkinter GUI.

#### Step 2:

Either copy/paste or manually define the encoded URL.

#### Step 3:

Review the output from the GUI.
